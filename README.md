# ValoSpectra - Server

Spectra is your all-in-one solution for an amazing looking Valorant Tournament Overlay, enabling all Organizers to display information like held gun, available credits etc. with just a single spectator running software.
It is comprised of three parts:
 - [The Spectra Client](https://github.com/ValoSpectra/Spectra-Client)
   - Running this software on a single in-game observer provides the Spectra Server with all data currently provided by Overwolf.
 - [The Spectra Server](https://github.com/ValoSpectra/Spectra-Server)
   - Ingests data from the Observer Client to reproduce the games state, allowing us to have an accurate representation of the game for further use.
 - [The Spectra Frontend](https://github.com/ValoSpectra/Spectra-Frontend)
   - Receives the game state from the Server every 100 milliseconds, presenting it in a beautiful manner for viewers to enjoy.

Further updates for new features, as well as a detailed setup guide and an easy to host docker container are in the pipeline!
